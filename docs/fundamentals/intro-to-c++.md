# Introduction to C++

## What is C++?

C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages in **competitive programming**, **software development**, and **system programming**.
It is known for:

* **Speed & efficiency** (close to the hardware, used in high-performance applications).
* **Flexibility** (supports both procedural and object-oriented programming).
* **Rich standard library (STL)** with powerful tools like vectors, sets, maps, and algorithms.

Because of its performance and versatility, **C++ is the main language used in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)** and most competitive programming contests.

## Why do we need VS Code?

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a **free, lightweight, and powerful code editor**.
For C++ learners, it is useful because:

* It supports **extensions** (C++ IntelliSense, debugging, formatting).
* It works on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.
* It makes it easier to **compile, run, and debug** C++ programs.
* It integrates well with Git, so you can manage your projects and track changes easily.
