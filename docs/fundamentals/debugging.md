# Debugging Practices

Debugging is a core skill in competitive programming. Writing a correct algorithm is only half the work — you also need to make sure your code actually runs as expected, and be able to correct it if a mistake is found.

## 🔑 Key Advices

* Always **try the problem on paper first** before coding.
* Have a **clear idea of your algorithm and used data structures**. If possible, write an outline on paper before implementing (avoid blind coding).
* Test on **small and extremal cases** that you can check manually.
* Be careful with **fast I/O** and watch out for **integer overflow**.
* Use **`cerr` instead of `cout`** for debugging (since graders usually ignore `cerr`).
* A **debugger** is often more powerful than console output.
* Learn to use **`assert`** to verify assumptions in your code.
* Compare your solution with a **bruteforce solution** on small cases to locate discrepancies.
* **Train your debugging skills**: don’t immediately read the editorial just because your mistake seems “dumb” — solving it yourself is part of the training.
